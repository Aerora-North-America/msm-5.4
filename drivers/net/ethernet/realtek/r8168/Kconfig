	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Realtek devices. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_REALTEK

config R8168
	tristate "Realtek 8168 ethernet support"
	default n if R8169
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	   Say Y here if you have a Realtek Ethernet adapter belonging to
	   the following families:
	   RTL8168 Gigabit Ethernet

	   To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	   will be called r8168.  This is recommended.
